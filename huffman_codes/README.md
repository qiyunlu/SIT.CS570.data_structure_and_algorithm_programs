# Huffman Codes
### Write a program that takes any input text and produces both a frequency table and the corresponding Huffman code
> 1. Take approximately 360 words from any English document as your input text. Ignore all blanks, all punctuation marks, all special symbols. Create an input file with this input text.
> 2. Construct the frequency table according to the input text read from the file:
>> 1. The frequency's must be listed, in order, from largest (at the top) to smallest (at the bottom)
> 3. Then, using the Huffman algorithm, construct the optimal prefix binary code for the table.
>> 1. The Huffman codes will be sorted in the same manner as the one above. i.e. frequency, highest to lowest.
> 4. Design your program to read the input from the input file "infile.dat". Your program must produce the output, in the file "outfile.dat",(Files must be named "infile.dat" and "outfile.dat") consisting of:
>> 1. the frequency table for the source text
>> 2. the Huffman code for each letter and digit in the source code, and
>> 3. the length of the coded message in terms of number of bits
